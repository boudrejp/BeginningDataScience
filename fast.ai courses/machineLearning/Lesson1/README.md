  * Note the lesson wiki and additional resources at the bottom
* Go through the associated notebook on crestle. Run each cell of code, and write comments to yourself to say what each code block is doing. You don't need to understand it the whole way, just try to have a general idea.
* Choose a dataset for a regression problem with which you can replicate the analysis
