* Go through the lecture at https://course.fast.ai/lessonsml1/lesson3.html
  * Note the additional links
* Go through the associated notebook wherever you are doing your follow-up work (crestle, local, otherwise...)
  * Put in comments to explain what each block of code is doing, and why you are doing it
* For the additional data set that you worked with for parts 1 + 2, follow the analysis of lecture 3 using the same data.
