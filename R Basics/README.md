# R Basics

A tutorial for those familiar with basic coding concepts such as loops and conditional statements. This will not be going over thinking algorithmically, but more about how to do things in R.

## Ways to learn R
There are two main ways I would recommend learning R, both of which do not require buying any books. They both go over the same fundamental concepts, and in more or less the same order. The advantages of one over the other just boil down to the way you'd prefer to learn the material. The two ways are:
* __Swirl__: learning R, in R.
  * To use this, open up a R session in R studio. Run the following commands in the console (type after the `>` and hit enter):
    * `install.packages("swirl")` (this installs the software package that contains the modules to learn R)
    * `library(swirl)` (this will open the swirl package into the current session)
    * `swirl()` (this begins the swirl module)
  * After following the above steps, the swirl program will give you prompts to go through all the relevant material afterwards.
* [__PreludeInR__](preludeinr.com): Learn R with bad jokes
  * To use this, just go to the website and start going through the content in order.
    * If you're going to use this, __PLEASE__ have a session of R open and go through the commands yourself. It may seem redundant, but you will get a lot more out of it if you just end up typing the code yourself.

In my book, both of these are good ways to learn R basics and a little bit of how to do statistics in R. For the most part, they cover the same material so I think that doing both would be redunandant and not useful. So pick one and stick with it, and you'll be good on learning R basics.
