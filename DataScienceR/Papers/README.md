* __Math4ML__: A paper that goes through the mathematical foundations of machine learning. This ranges from probability to calculus to optimization topics. If you want a deeper look under the hood of what is going on in machine learning, this is a very good overview. For the purposes of becoming an entry-level data analyst, this isn't absolutely necessary reading but would be important to know these topics to move onto creating your own algorithms.
* __Use Notes- DataScience__: This paper is very high level and goes over some practical considerations for performing data science analyses. This is pretty accessible for someone with only a high level knowledge.
