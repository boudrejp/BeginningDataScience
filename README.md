# BeginningDataScience
A repo for materials for engineering PDPs to learn general data science and computer science concepts

## __Breakdown of materials__
  1. Command line knowledge
  2. Understanding git
  3. Basic R knowledge (swirl package, general questions)
  4. Basic R projects (use of dplyr, caret, ggplot2)
    * Use of Kaggle datasets would be good here
  5. Simple R project to demonstrate reactivity concepts.
    * Needs to have a statistical model that will generate predictions based on user input
  6. Basic SQL knowledge, relational database knowledge
  7. *Bonus* Parallel computing concepts
  8. *Bonus* Http protocol, proxies, firewalls, APIs... build a project to obtain API data and display
  9. *Bonus* How to create R packages

## __Prereqs__
  * You will need R and R studio installed on your device. *Note: If doing this on your work device, you will need local admin rights*
    * R: https://cran.r-project.org/
    * R Studio: https://www.rstudio.com/ (You want R Studio Desktop, the free version)
    * Jupyter Notebooks: http://jupyter.org/
    * Python >= 3.5: https://www.python.org/
  * Knowledge of basic statistics
    * Linear Regression, standard deviations, normal distributions, hypothesis testing should be pretty intuitive to you
  * Knowledge of calculus concepts
    * You should be familiar with gradient descent at a minimum
  * Experience in coding and thinking algorithmically
    * Particular language is not important
    * Should be able to pseudocode something like a basic sorting algorithm
    * Know when and why you would want to use the following: if/else statements, for loop, while loop
  * A desire to learn more about data science and expand your data analysis skills!
